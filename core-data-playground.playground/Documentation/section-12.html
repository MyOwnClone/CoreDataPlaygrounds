    <p>Next declare the one-to-many relationship between <code>City</code> and <code>Neighborhoods</code>. The relationship needs to be declared on both ends, or between both entities. On one end of the relationship, the <code>neighborhoodEntity</code> is setup with a <code>maxCount</code> of zero. On the other end, the <code>cityEntity</code> is given a <code>maxCount</code> of one. This defines both ends of the relationship. To connect the relationship fully, set the <code>inverseRelationship</code> property on each relationship to point to the other.</p>
